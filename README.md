## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS (Custom properties, Flexbox, Grid)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS pre-processor
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to write regular expressions (regex) and used them to validate strings. Also, I learned how to implement event delegation, which helped me to significantly reduce the number of events in the project and made the project more scalable.

### Useful resources

- [regex101](https://regex101.com/) - This website was very useful for testing the regex I wrote.
- [Studytonight](https://www.studytonight.com/post/build-a-theme-switcher-for-your-website-with-javascript) - This article taught me how to implement the logic of the theme switcher used in this project.
